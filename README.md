### Hi there 👋
I'm David (He/Him)

As a creative developer, I have a passion for coding, interactivity and visual design.

## Coding 👨‍🚀
I'm currently doing a Web Developement bootcamp with HyperionDev. Although I have working experience developing interactive digital experiences, everything I've learnt is self-taught, so doing this bootcamp is a certified recognition of my frontend skills.
